/*!
 * \brief The TypeGuard class.
 *
 * This is the type guard class. This class ensures that the different type
 * classes defined in the Open Walker project that derive from Eigen type
 * classes are not copy constructable or assignable to each other.
 *
 * Type classes that need to type safe need to derive from this class and
 * add the macro #OW_TYPE_GUARD(Class) at the very top of the class declaration:

  \code{.cpp}
    namespace ow_core{

    template <typename _Scalar>
    class LinearPosition :
        public LinearPositionRef<Eigen::Matrix<_Scalar,3,1> >,
        public TypeGuard
    {
      OW_TYPE_GUARD(LinearPosition)

      // ...

    };

    } // namespace ow_core
  \endcode


 *
 * E.g. The copy construction or assignment between LinearPosition and
 * LinearVelocity should never be allowed and throw an compilation error:

  \code{.cpp}
    ow::LinearPosition pos;
    ow::LinearVelocity vel;

    // Creates compilation error
    pos = vel;
  \endcode

 * \note The compilation errors are:
 *  - the copy constructor is protected
 *  - the assignment operator is ambiguous
 *
 * In the few cases where these type classes need to be assigned to each other
 * use static type casts to a common base class in the inheritance hierarchy,
 * e.g.:

  \code{.cpp}
    // Correct type conversion
    vel = static_cast<const ow::Vector3&>(pos);
  \endcode
