/*! \def OW_PLUGIN_CLASS_CREATE(Class)
    \brief A macro that creates the create factory function for the \a Class.

 * \note The static_cast from 'Class*' to 'IGenericClass*' is
 * essential. The void* is casted back with reinterpret_cast to
 * 'IGenericClass*'. This fails with seg fault when not previously
 * using static_cast.
 *
 * \note The upcasting from 'IGenericClass*' to 'Class*' must
 * be again done with static_cast!
 *
 * \note Use this macro only once per .so file!

/*! \def OW_PLUGIN_CLASS_DESTROY(Class)
 *  \brief A macro that creates the destroy factory function for the \a Class.
 *
 * \note The destruction should run from top to down
 * (should be less error prone than down to top).
 *
 * \note Since classes should be created by the factory they
 * should also be deleted by the factory to avoid memory
 * corruptions when the .so file has been compiled with
 * a different compiler (version) then the loader
 * of the .so file.
 *
 * \note Use this macro only once per .so file!
